# Blue team labs

This repository documents my learning path of projects focused on core defensive security concepts, equipping learners with the skills to detect, analyze, and respond to cyber threats in a practical, hands-on environment.  
It was developed using Hack The Box's **Intro to Blue Team** track, which simulates real-world defensive scenarios.
